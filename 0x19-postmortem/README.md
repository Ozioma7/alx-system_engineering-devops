TASK 0: My first postmortem

**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration of Outage:** The outage occurred on January 28, 2024, from 3:00 PM to 5:30 PM (WAT).
- **Impact:** The website's main service experienced downtime, resulting in slow or inaccessible pages for approximately 60% of users. Users reported encountering error messages and difficulties accessing various features of the site.
- **Root Cause:** The root cause of the outage was identified as a sudden increase in traffic combined with database query optimization issues, leading to server overload and subsequent performance degradation.

**Timeline:**

- **3:00 PM (WAT):** Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a significant increase in server response times.
- **3:15 PM (WAT):** Engineers initiated investigation, suspecting potential server overload or network issues.
- **3:30 PM (WAT):** Initial assumption focused on network connectivity problems, leading to exploration of router configurations and external connections.
- **4:00 PM (WAT):** Upon ruling out network issues, attention shifted to server-side components, particularly database performance.
- **4:45 PM (WAT):** Incident escalated to senior engineering team for additional support and expertise.
- **5:30 PM (WAT):** Issue resolved by implementing database query optimizations and scaling server resources to accommodate increased traffic.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Root Cause Explanation:** The issue stemmed from a sudden surge in user traffic, combined with inefficient database queries consuming excessive server resources. This resulted in server overload and degradation of website performance.
- **Resolution Details:** The issue was resolved by optimizing database queries to improve efficiency and scaling server resources to handle the increased workload. Additionally, measures were implemented to enhance monitoring and capacity planning for future traffic spikes.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improvement Opportunities:**
  - Implement automated scaling mechanisms to dynamically adjust server resources based on traffic patterns.
  - Conduct regular performance testing and optimization of database queries to maintain system efficiency.
  - Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to provide early detection of potential issues and prevent similar outages.

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  1. Optimize database queries to improve efficiency.
  2. Implement automated scaling mechanisms for server resources.
  3. Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to provide proactive detection of performance issues.
  4. Conduct capacity planning exercises to ensure the system can handle anticipated increases in traffic.

By addressing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to strengthen the resilience of our infrastructure and minimize the likelihood of similar incidents occurring in the future.
